        Envision developed the strategic planning web application that allows organizations to lay out their plans by defining their goals. Each goal's progress can be tracked and measured to ensure the operational plan is under control. At the very core, their strategic planning software consists of 3 main modules such as planning, reporting, and analyzing. For this case-study, I only talk about the planning module, and I'll post another case studies for the other modules.

        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        Envisio wanted to optimize the software user-flow of their planning module. To ensure this project meets the business requirements and feasibility from the technical perspective, I collaborated with the product manager, customer success team, and developers.

        <h3>My Role</h3>
        In this project, my role was as a UI / UX designer and front-end developer. Some of the responsibilities were:
        <ul>
          <li>Requirements gathering</li>
          <li>Feature audit</li>
          <li>User testings</li>
          <li>Wireframes and Hi-fi mockups</li>
          <li>React front-end development</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Problems</h3>
        We got some feedback from customers to improve the functionality and the visibility of the overall plan view. Especially when the planning gets bigger, users were having a hard time finding items that buried inside on the lower level of the plan. Some visual alternative and quick ways to find items could potentially improve the usability of the software.
