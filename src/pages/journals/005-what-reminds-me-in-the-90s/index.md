I was born in 1987, so, basically, I spent my childhood in the 90s. A lot of things I experienced for the first time like playing video games, cycling, swimming, going to the theatre, on the airplane, getting slapped, getting punched and soon. With all those things, I still consider the 90s is the best decade of my life. Some stuff reminds me of the 90s vividly.

#VHR
VHR is the first recorded video that I've ever used. My dad used to collect them in his big drawer until they got dusty, and eventually ruined the video quality. Either way, it still reminds me of good old days where I watched some classic movies for the first time like Jurassic Park, Robocop, Home Alone 1.

#Walkman
When I was in elementary school, I remember to be a cool kid who listens to music, having a Walkman is a must-have. It was the king of portable music before people using a mobile phone or even an iPod.

#Home milk delivery
I used to play outside in the morning when I was little, so I often saw milk delivery putting bottles of fresh milk door to door. Part of the reason milk delivery was slowing down because of the advancement of refrigeration that becomes more common in households than ever before. a Family who owns a refrigerator can keep the milk longer.
