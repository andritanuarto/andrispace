When I was watching a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMM8i5nIQ00">YouTube video</a> from Petrolicious about Ferrari Testarossa, it reminded me about this car poster from back in the early 90s, and this model remains to be one of my favourite Ferrari models of all time. To me, Testarossa represents how the supercar should look like; it has a fiery red colour and it looks fast even without seeing it running. That video inspired me to work on the scale model for that car. Luckily I found the model from eBay made by Japanese manufacture called Tamiya. If you're interested you can buy it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ebay.ca/sch/i.html?_ssc=1&_nkw=tamiya+ferrari+testarossa">here</a>.

Started with the cockpit, I would say this is the easiest part although it's alot of detail but to be honest working on the cockpit is more forgiving because I didn't need to do any polishing, and I think it looks realistic enough. For this project I'm staying conservative how the Ferrari looks like and I chose beige color for most of the interior part.

Like the shape and color of Testarossa's engine and the color of red gives a nice contrast from dominant black and silver colors.

This is the part that I feel I need to improve more, because to have good body paint it must look flawless and also alot of masking expecially for black window frame and the polishing part which is very meticolous process. In the end love the result. The red is exactly what I was looking for.
